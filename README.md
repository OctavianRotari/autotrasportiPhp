# autotrasportiPhp (WIP)

##Introduction

This project was relatively personal, as I created it for my familyâ€™s company
to give them an online presence and increase their business exponentially as
well as further improving my skills.The company already had purchased a domain
name on an Apache server, thus my development plan had to adapt accordinly.
this was one of my first projects after finishing makers academy, so it is
somewhat rudimentary.  Therefore my intention is to bring it into a more
refined and advanced position, with my newly acquired skills and continue this
modification as too my skills develop.

##Approach

First I completed a course on php, adding another coding language to my
repertoire.  Next I drew up a framework for the website, shaping it to the
potential audience for the website.  After rigorous testing and refinement, I
deployed it to the server and conversed with my parents to ensure it had met
their requirements.  Now this an active site in continuous maintenance by
myself and the first point of contact my family has with many of their clients.

##Conclusions

Planning was at the forefront of lessons learnt. There were a lot of predefined
specifications that i had to bear in mind in this project, e.g. the apache
server, the need to use php language, the specifications on aesthetics that my
family had made and so on. thus without effective planning, and breaking down
the project into manageable chunks and milestones, this could have occupied an
enormous amount of time, which i could not afford to take away from other
projects.
